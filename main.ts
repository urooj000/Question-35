// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

const animals: string[] = ["Dog", "Cat", "Horse"];

console.log("Names of animals:");
for (const animal of animals) {
    console.log(animal);
}
console.log("Statement about animals:");
for (const animal of animals) {
    switch (animal) { 
        case "Dog":
            console.log("A dog would make a great Pet.");

            case "Cat":
                console.log("A cat can be an independent companion.");
                    break;
                    case "Horse":
                        console.log("A horse are majestic animals known for their strenghth, speed and garace.");
